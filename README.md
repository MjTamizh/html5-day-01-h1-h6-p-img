# Day 01 – HTML5 (Beginner Practice)

Welcome to Day 01 of the Frontend Developer Roadmap.

This project is created for beginners who are starting to learn HTML.

Today you will learn only three basic HTML elements.

## Topics for Today

- Headings (h1 to h6)
- Paragraph (p)
- Image (img)

## Your Task

1. Learn how the following tags work:
   - h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6
   - p
   - img

2. After learning, open the `index.html` file and understand how:
   - headings are used to structure a page
   - text is written using the paragraph tag
   - an image is added using the img tag

## Practice Goal

Create a simple personal profile page using only:

- h1 to h6
- p
- img

Do NOT use any other HTML tags.
Do NOT use CSS for this task.

## What You Should Be Able To Do After This Day

- Create page titles using heading tags
- Write content using paragraph tags
- Display an image using the img tag
- Understand basic page structure

## Learning Source

Learn the concepts for today from W3Schools (HTML tutorial).

## Files

- index.html

## Note for Students

This project is only for practice.
Focus on understanding the tags, not design.

Move to Day 02 only after you clearly understand:

how and when to use h1–h6, p and img.
